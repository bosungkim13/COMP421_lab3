Tested with provided provided and sample tests. Completed further testing
with tests from https://github.com/cannontwo/Comp-421-Tests/tree/master/lab3/wcl2 and 
has passed successfully. 

I use a boolean array to keep track of free inodes and blocks. Further, I have
separate caches, one for inodes and one for blocks.
